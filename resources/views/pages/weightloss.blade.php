            <h1 class="page-header text-danger">The Reality of Weight Loss</h1>

            <p class ="text-light"> Most people, when they decide to cut weight, simply become more active.
          Although becoming more active helps immensly with your <br>overall health, this is not exactly the key to weight loss.
          Being active can lower your weight on the scale, but it will not<br> change how you look like.<br>
          &emsp; The only way to change your appearance is by decreasing your <b>Body Fat Percentage</b>(BFP). The thing is that most<br>
          people rely on the scale too much. In order for you to actually change how your body looks, you should not be focusing on the scale<br>
          but rather on how much calories you consume on a daily basis. A lot of people suggest that in order for a person to lose weight<br>
          they should go on a diet, or decrease the "bad" food. The reality here is that every single diet is centered around one thing<br>
          and that thing is having a <b>caloric deficit</b>. This means that you consume less calories than what your body needs, thus making
          your body<br> use its fat supplies and subsequently decreasing your BFP, and changing your appearance.</p>

          <h2 class="page-header text-danger">The Correct and the Wrong Way of Achieving it</h2>

          <p class ="text-light"> It is true that there is only one way to decrease BFP and that is by consuming less calories than your <b>Total Daily Energy Expenditure</b>(TDEE).<br>
        But there are right and wrong ways to achieve that. For example just because you can lower your BFP by only eating junk food,<br> does not mean that this is the optimal way.
        The food that you consume on a daily basis makes a big difference on how your body will look like<br>
        after you decrease your BFP. If a person is eating healthy and also maintaining a caloric deficit, that person will look far better<br>
        than another person that is also on a caloric deficit but is not eating as healthy. The reason for that is that<br>
        the person which has the healthier diet, tends to consume more protein than the person with the less healthy diet,<br>
        thus maintaining more muscle mass. In the end both people will have around the same amount of body fat, but the person with<br>
        more muscles will look fitter than the person that has had alot of junk food in their diet.<br>&emsp; Notice that did not mention their weight anywhere, because in the end of the day the fitter person with more muslces
        <br> will weigh more than his counterpart with the same BFP, but he will generally look better and more healthier despite the weight.</p>
        
        <h2 class="page-header text-danger">The steps to success</h2>

        <p class ="text-light"> So now you might be asking yourself : "Okay, so what are the steps to do the actual weight cutting?". Well, there are many answers<br> to that question
	  but all of them start with calculating your <b>TDEE</b>. You can do that by going to <a href="https://tdeecalculator.net/">this site</a>. When it comes to weight loss<br>
	  there are two main rules that you have to follow. The first and most important one is to make sure you are eating less calories than your daily needs<br>
	  and the only way you can do that and actually be sure of it, is if you keep track of your caloric intake, by weighing your food, and using an app<br>that keeps track of your calores.
	  I know that that sounds like much, but people underestimate or overestimate the amount of calories they<br> actually consume. For example a person with higher BFP will
	  say that they don't eat anything but somehow they don't lose weight, the opposite<br> is a person ,that is clearly underweight, saying that he or she is eating non stop, but still
	  not gaining any weight. In both cases, the only real fact<br> is that they overestimate or underestimate their caloric intake. So if you want the optimal way to decrease your BFP you need to be ready to<br> <b>count your calories</b>. <br>
	  The other major thing is that you should keep track of your protein consumption per day. Usually if you start using an app that counts your<br> calories like - <b>MyFitnessPal</b>
	  you wouldn't need to worry about it, because the app already does that for you. Usually you want to maintain<br>0.8 to 1 gram of protein per lbs. Making sure your protein
	  is high enough is critical, in order for you to look great even if you lose a lot of<br> weight. Keeping protein intake high means that there is much less muslce loss
	  when cutting. That is very important because having higher<br> muscle mass comes with a huge assortment of positives, including being able to eat more, without gaining much weight<br>
	  which most people call "increased metabolism", but this is due to the fact that muscles require more energy to maintain. Another positive<br> of having more muscle mass is
    that your immune system is stronger and you yourself are stronger.</p>
